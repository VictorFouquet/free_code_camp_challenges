        Redux: Create a Redux Store

            Redux is a state management framework that can be used with a number of different web technologies, including React.

            In Redux, there is a single state object that's responsible for the entire state of your application. 
            This means if we had a React app with ten components, and each component had its own local state, the entire state of our app 
            would be defined by a single state object housed in the Redux store. 
            This is the first important principle to understand when learning Redux: the Redux store is the single source of truth when it comes to application state.

            This also means that any time any piece of our app wants to update state, it must do so through the Redux store. 
            The unidirectional data flow makes it easier to track state management in our app.

            The Redux store is an object which holds and manages application state. 
            There is a method called createStore() on the Redux object, which we use to create the Redux store. 
            This method takes a reducer function as a required argument. 
            The reducer function is covered in a later challenge. 
            It simply takes state as an argument and returns state.

        var reducer = (state = 5) => {
            return state;
        };

        var store = Redux.createStore(reducer);
        
        console.log(`Here's the Redux store object :`);
        console.log(store)

        {/* 
            Alternative Syntax : 
        
        const store = Redux.createStore(
            ({login: false}) => state
        );

        Redux: Get State from the Redux Store

            The Redux store object provides several methods that allow us to interact with it. 
            For example, we can retrieve the current state held in the Redux store object with the getState() method.

        */}
        
        var state = store.getState();
        
        console.log(`And here's the store's current state : `);
        console.log(state)

        {/*

        Redux: Define a Redux Action

            Since Redux is a state management framework, updating state is one of its core tasks. 
            In Redux, all state updates are triggered by dispatching actions. 
            An action is simply a JavaScript object that contains information about an action event that has occurred. 
            The Redux store receives these action objects, then updates its state accordingly. 
            Sometimes a Redux action also carries some data. 
            For example, the action carries a username after a user logs in. 
            While the data is optional, actions must carry a type property that specifies the 'type' of action that occurred.

            Think of Redux actions as messengers that deliver information about events happening in our app to the Redux store. 
            The store then conducts the business of updating state based on the action that occurred.

        */}
        
        var action = {
            type: 'LOGIN'
        }

        {/* 

            ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

        Redux: Define an Action Creator

            After creating an action, the next step is sending the action to the Redux store so it can update its state. 
            In Redux, you define action creators to accomplish this. 
            An action creator is simply a JavaScript function that returns an action. 
            In other words, action creators create objects that represent action events.

        */}
        
        function loginAction() {
            return action
        }

        console.log("This is an action sent by an action creator :")
        console.log(loginAction())
        
        {/* 

            ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

        Redux: Dispatch an Action Event

            dispatch method is what we use to dispatch actions to the Redux store. 
            Calling store.dispatch() and passing the value returned from an action creator sends an action back to the store.

            Recall that action creators return an object with a type property that specifies the action that has occurred. 
            Then the method dispatches an action object to the Redux store. 
            Based on the previous challenge's example, the following lines are equivalent, and both dispatch the action of type LOGIN:

                store.dispatch(actionCreator());
                store.dispatch({ type: 'LOGIN' });


        */}
        
        store.dispatch(loginAction())

        {/* 

            ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

        Redux: Handle an Action in the Store

            After an action is created and dispatched, the Redux store needs to know how to respond to that action. 
            This is the job of a reducer function. 
            Reducers in Redux are responsible for the state modifications that take place in response to actions. 
            A reducer takes state and action as arguments, and it always returns a new state. 
            It is important to see that this is the only role of the reducer. 
            It has no side effects â€” it never calls an API endpoint and it never has any hidden surprises. 
            The reducer is simply a pure function that takes state and action, then returns new state.

            Another key principle in Redux is that state is read-only. 
            In other words, the reducer function must always return a new copy of state and never modify state directly. 
            Redux does not enforce state immutability, however, we are responsible for enforcing it in the code of our reducer functions. 
            We'll practice this in later challenges.

        var defaultState = {
            login: false
        }

        reducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
            if (action.type === 'LOGIN') {
                return { login: true }
            }
            return state
        }

        store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

        console.log("Here is a store's default state :")
        console.log(store.getState())

        store.dispatch(loginAction());

        console.log("And it's updated state once it's been dispatched an action :")

        Redux: Use a Switch Statement to Handle Multiple Actions

            We can tell the Redux store how to handle multiple action types. 
            Say we are managing user authentication in our Redux store. 
            We want to have a state representation for when users are logged in and when they are logged out. 
            We represent this with a single state object with the property authenticated. 
            We also need action creators that create actions corresponding to user login and user logout, along with the action objects themselves.
        
        Redux: Use const for Action Types

            A common practice when working with Redux is to assign action types as read-only constants, 
            then reference these constants wherever they are used. 

        */}
        
        const LOGIN = 'LOGIN';
        const LOGOUT = 'LOGOUT';

        defaultState = {
            authenticate: false
        }

        var authReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
            switch(action.type){
                case LOGIN:
                    return { authenticate : true }
                    break;
                case LOGOUT:
                    return { authenticate : false }
                    break;
                default:
                    return state;
            }
        }

        store = Redux.createStore(authReducer);

        var loginUser = () => {
            return {
                type: LOGIN
            }
        }

        var logoutUser = () => {
            return {
                type: LOGOUT
            }
        }

        console.log("Here's a store's default state, updated by a login user action and updated again by a logout user action :")

        console.log(store.getState());

        store.dispatch(loginUser());
        console.log(store.getState());
        
        store.dispatch(logoutUser());
        console.log(store.getState());

        {/*

        Redux: Register a Store Listener

            Another method we have access to on the Redux store object is store.subscribe(). 
            This allows us to subscribe listener functions to the store, which are called whenever an action is dispatched against the store. 
            One simple use for this method is to subscribe a function to our store that simply logs a message every time an action is received and the store is updated. 

        */}
        
        const ADD = 'ADD';

        reducer = (state = 0, action) => {
            switch (action.type) {
                case ADD:
                    return state + 1;
                    break;
                default:
                    return state;
            }
        }

        store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

        var count = 0;

        var increment = () => {
            count += 1
        };
        
        store.subscribe(increment);
        
        console.log("Incrementation of a store's state with a callback function subscribed to this store :")
        console.log(store.getState())

        store.dispatch({type: ADD})
        console.log(store.getState())

        store.dispatch({type: ADD})
        console.log(store.getState())

        store.dispatch({type: ADD})
        console.log(store.getState())
