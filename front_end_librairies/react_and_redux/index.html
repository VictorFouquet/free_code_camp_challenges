        React and Redux: Getting Started with React Redux

            This series of challenges introduces how to use Redux with React.

            First, here's a review of some of the key principles of each technology. 
            React is a view library that you provide with data, then it renders the view in an efficient, predictable way. 
            Redux is a state management framework that you can use to simplify the management of your application's state. 

            Typically, in a React Redux app, we create a single Redux store that manages the state of our entire app. 
            Our React components subscribe to only the pieces of data in the store that are relevant to their role. 
            Then, we dispatch actions directly from React components, which then trigger store updates.

            Although React components can manage their own state locally, when we have a complex app, 
            it's generally better to keep the app state in a single location with Redux. 
            There are exceptions when individual components may have local state specific only to them. 
            Finally, because Redux is not designed to work with React out of the box, we need to use the react-redux package. 
            It provides a way for us to pass Redux state and dispatch to our React components as props.

            Over the next few challenges, first, we'll create a simple React component which allows us to input new text messages. 
            These are added to an array that's displayed in the view. 
            This should be a nice review of what we learned in the React lessons. 
            Next, we'll create a Redux store and actions that manage the state of the messages array. 
            Finally, we'll use react-redux to connect the Redux store with your component, thereby extracting the local state into the Redux store.
        
        React and Redux: Manage State Locally First

            First, in the render() method, the component render an input element, button element, and ul element. 
            When the input element changes, it should trigger a handleChange() method. 
            Also, the input element should render the value of input that's in the component's state. 
            The button element should trigger a submitMessage() method when it's clicked.

            Second, the handleChange() method should update the input with what the user is typing. 
            The submitMessage() method should concatenate the current message (stored in input) to the messages array in local state, and clear the value of the input.

            Finally, we use the ul to map over the array of messages and render it to the screen as a list of li elements.

                    input: '',
                    messages: []
                }

        React and Redux: Extract State Logic to Redux

            Now that we finished the React component, we need to move the logic it's performing locally in its state into Redux. 
            This is the first step to connect the simple React app to Redux. 
            The only functionality our app has is to add new messages from the user to an unordered list. 
            The example is simple in order to demonstrate how React and Redux work together.

        React and Redux: Use Provider to Connect Redux to React

            In the last challenge, we created a Redux store to handle the messages array and created an action for adding new messages. 
            The next step is to provide React access to the Redux store and the actions it needs to dispatch updates. 
            React Redux provides its react-redux package to help accomplish these tasks.

            React Redux provides a small API with two key features: Provider and connect. 
            Another challenge covers connect. 
            The Provider is a wrapper component from React Redux that wraps our React app. 
            This wrapper then allows you to access the Redux store and dispatch functions throughout our component tree. 
            Provider takes two props, the Redux store and the child components of our app. 
            Defining the Provider for an App component might look like this:

                <Provider store={store}>
                <App/>
                </Provider>
        */}
        
        {/*

        const Provider = ReactRedux.Provider;
        
        */}

        {/* 
            ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

        React and Redux: Map State to Props

            The Provider component allows us to provide state and dispatch to our React components, but we must specify exactly what state and actions we want. 
            This way, we make sure that each component only has access to the state it needs. 
            We accomplish this by creating two functions: mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps().

            In these functions, we declare what pieces of state we want to have access to and which action creators we need to be able to dispatch. 
            Once these functions are in place, we'll see how to use the React Redux connect method to connect them to our components in another challenge.
        */}

        {/*

        const state = [];
        
        const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
            return {messages: state}
        };

        store.subscribe(mapStateToProps())

        */}

        {/* 
            ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
        
        React and Redux: Map Dispatch to Props
  
            The mapDispatchToProps() function is used to provide specific action creators to our React components so they can dispatch actions against the Redux store. 
            It's similar in structure to the mapStateToProps() function we wrote in the last challenge. 
            It returns an object that maps dispatch actions to property names, which become component props. 
            However, instead of returning a piece of state, each property returns a function that calls dispatch with an action creator and any relevant action data. 
            We have access to this dispatch because it's passed in to mapDispatchToProps() as a parameter when we define the function, 
            just like we passed state to mapStateToProps(). 
            Behind the scenes, React Redux is using Redux's store.dispatch() to conduct these dispatches with mapDispatchToProps(). 
            This is similar to how it uses store.subscribe() for components that are mapped to state.

            For example, we have a loginUser() action creator that takes a username as an action payload. 
            The object returned from mapDispatchToProps() for this action creator would look something like:

                {
                    submitLoginUser: function(username) {
                        dispatch(loginUser(username));
                    }
                }

        */}

        {/*  

        const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
            return {
                submitNewMessage: function(message) {
                    dispatch(addMessage(message))
                }
            }
        }

        store.subscribe(mapDispatchToProps())
        
        */}

        {/* 
            ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
     
        React and Redux: Connect Redux to React

            Now that we've written both the mapStateToProps() and the mapDispatchToProps() functions, 
            we can use them to map state and dispatch to the props of one of our React components. 
            The connect method from React Redux can handle this task. 
            This method takes two optional arguments, mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps(). 
            They are optional because you may have a component that only needs access to state but doesn't need to dispatch any actions, or vice versa.

            To use this method, we pass in the functions as arguments, and immediately call the result with your component. 
            This syntax is a little unusual and looks like:

                connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent)

            Note: If we want to omit one of the arguments to the connect method, we pass null in its place.

        React and Redux: Connect Redux to the Messages App

            Now that we understand how to use connect to connect React to Redux, we can apply what you've learned to our React component that handles messages.

            In the last lesson, the component we connected to Redux was named Presentational, and this wasn't arbitrary. 
            This term generally refers to React components that are not directly connected to Redux. 
            They are simply responsible for the presentation of UI and do this as a function of the props they receive. 
            By contrast, container components are connected to Redux. 
            These are typically responsible for dispatching actions to the store and often pass store state to child components as props.

            ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
       
        React and Redux: Extract Local State into Redux

            We're almost done! Recall that we wrote all the Redux code so that Redux could control the state management of our React messages app. 
            Now that Redux is connected, we need to extract the state management out of the Presentational component and into Redux. 
            Currently, we have Redux connected, but we are handling the state locally within the Presentational component.

            In the Presentational component, first, we remove the messages property in the local state. 
            These messages will be managed by Redux. 
            Next, we modify the submitMessage() method so that it dispatches submitNewMessage() from this.props, 
            and pass in the current message input from local state as an argument. 
            Because we removed messages from local state, we remove the messages property from the call to this.setState() here as well. 
            Finally, we modify the render() method so that it maps over the messages received from props rather than state.

            Once these changes are made, the app will continue to function the same, except Redux manages the state. 
            This example also illustrates how a component may have local state: your component still tracks user input locally in its own state. 
            We can see how Redux provides a useful state management framework on top of React. 
            We achieved the same result using only React's local state at first, 
            and this is usually possible with simple apps. 
            However, as our apps become larger and more complex, so does our state management, and this is the problem Redux solves.

        React and Redux: Moving Forward From HerePassed

            We finished the lessons on React and Redux. 
            There's one last item worth pointing out before we move on. 
            Typically, we won't write React apps in a code editor like this. 
            This challenge gives us a glimpse of what the syntax looks like if we're working with npm and a file system on our own machine. 
            The code should look similar, except for the use of import statements. 
            The "Managing Packages with npm" section covers npm in more detail.

            Finally, writing React and Redux code generally requires some configuration.
            This can get complicated quickly. 

            We can enable Babel as a JavaScript Preprocessor in CodePen, add React and ReactDOM as external JavaScript resources, and work there as well.

                // import React from 'react'
                // import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
                // import { Provider, connect } from 'react-redux'
                // import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'
                // import thunk from 'redux-thunk'

                // import rootReducer from './redux/reducers'
                // import App from './components/App'

                // const store = createStore(
                //   rootReducer,
                //   applyMiddleware(thunk)
                // );

                // ReactDOM.render(
                //   <Provider store={store}>
                //     <App/>
                //   </Provider>,
                //   document.getElementById('root')
                // );

        */}
