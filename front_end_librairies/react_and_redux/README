This series of challenges introduces how to use Redux with React.

In a React Redux app, we create a single Redux store that manages the state of our entire app. 
Our React components subscribe to only the pieces of data in the store that are relevant to their role.
Then, we dispatch actions directly from React components, which then trigger store updates.
