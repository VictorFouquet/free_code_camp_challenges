        React: Create a Stateful Component

            One of the most important topics in React is state. 
            State consists of any data our application needs to know about, that can change over time. 
            You want your apps to respond to state changes and present an updated UI when necessary. 
            React offers a nice solution for the state management of modern web applications.

            We create state in a React component by declaring a state property on the component class in its constructor. 
            This initializes the component with state when it is created. 
            The state property must be set to a JavaScript object. 
            Declaring it looks like this:

                this.state = {
                // describe your state here
                }

            We have access to the state object throughout the life of your component. 
            We can update it, render it in our UI, and pass it as props to child components. 
            The state object can be as complex or as simple as you need it to be. 
            Note that we must create a class component by extending React.Component in order to create state like this.

        class StatefulComponent extends React.Component {
            constructor(props) {
                super(props);
                this.state = {
                    name: 'My Stateful Component'
                };
            }

            render() {
                return (
                    <div>
                        <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
                    </div>
                )
            }
        }

        React: Render State in the User Interface

            Once we define a component's initial state, we can display any part of it in the UI that is rendered. 
            If a component is stateful, it will always have access to the data in state in its render() method. 
            We can access the data with this.state.

            If we want to access a state value within the return of the render method, we have to enclose the value in curly braces.

            State is one of the most powerful features of components in React. 
            It allows us to track important data in our app and render a UI in response to changes in this data. 
            If our data changes, our UI will change. 
            React uses what is called a virtual DOM, to keep track of changes behind the scenes. 
            When state data updates, it triggers a re-render of the components using that data - including child components that received the data as a prop. 
            React updates the actual DOM, but only where necessary. 
            This means we don't have to worry about changing the DOM. 
            We simply declare what the UI should look like.

            Note that if we make a component stateful, no other components are aware of its state. 
            Its state is completely encapsulated, or local to that component, unless we pass state data to a child component as props. 
            This notion of encapsulated state is very important because it allows us to write certain logic, 
            then have that logic contained and isolated in one place in your code.

        React: Render State in the User Interface Another Way

            There is another way to access state in a component. 
            In the render() method, before the return statement, you can write JavaScript directly. 
            For example, you could declare functions, access data from state or props, perform computations on this data, and so on. 
            Then, you can assign any data to variables, which you have access to in the return statement.

        */}

        class My1stComponent extends React.Component {
            constructor(props){
                super(props)
                this.state = {
                    firstName: "John",
                    lastName: "Doe"
                }
            }

                const lastName = this.state.lastName

                    <div>

        React: Set State with this.setState

            The previous challenges covered component state and how to initialize state in the constructor. 
            There is also a way to change the component's state. 
            React provides a method for updating component state called setState. 
            We call the setState method within your component class like so: this.setState(), passing in an object with key-value pairs. 
            The keys are your state properties and the values are the updated state data. 
            For instance, if we were storing a username in state and wanted to update it, it would look like this:

                this.setState({
                username: 'Lewis'
                });

            React expects you to never modify state directly, instead always use this.setState() when state changes occur. 
            Also, you should note that React may batch multiple state updates in order to improve performance. 
            What this means is that state updates through the setState method can be asynchronous. 
            There is an alternative syntax for the setState method which provides a way around this problem. 
            This is rarely needed but it's good to keep it in mind! Please consult the React documentation for further details.

            ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

        React: Bind 'this' to a Class Method

            In addition to setting and updating state, we can also define methods for our component class. 
            A class method typically needs to use the this keyword so it can access properties on the class (such as state and props) inside the scope of the method. 
            There are a few ways to allow our class methods to access this.

            One common way is to explicitly bind this in the constructor so this becomes bound to the class methods when the component is initialized. 

                this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this) 

            Then, when we call a function like

                this.setState() 

            within our class method, this refers to the class and will not be undefined.

        */}

        class My2ndComponent extends React.Component {
            constructor(props){
                super(props)
                this.state = {
                    name: "Initial State"
                }
                this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
            }

            handleClick() {
                this.setState({
                    name: "JohnDoe"
                })

                    <div>
                        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
                        <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>

        React: Use State to Toggle an Element

            Sometimes we might need to know the previous state when updating the state. 
            However, state updates may be asynchronous - this means React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update. 
            This means we can't rely on the previous value of this.state or this.props when calculating the next value. 
            So, we should not use code like this:

                this.setState({
                    counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment
                });

            Instead, we should pass setState a function that allows us to access state and props. 
            Using a function with setState guarantees we are working with the most current values of state and props. 
            This means that the above should be rewritten as:

                this.setState((state, props) => ({
                    counter: state.counter + props.increment
                }));

            We can also use a form without props if you need only the state:

                this.setState(state => ({
                    counter: state.counter + 1
                }));

            Note that we have to wrap the object literal in parentheses, otherwise JavaScript thinks it's a block of code.

        React: Create a Controlled Input

            Our application may have more complex interactions between state and the rendered UI. 
            For example, form control elements for text input, such as input and textarea, maintain their own state in the DOM as the user types. 
            With React, you can move this mutable state into a React component's state. 
            The user's input becomes part of the application state, so React controls the value of that input field. 
            Typically, if you have React components with input fields the user can type into, it will be a controlled input form.

        React: Pass State as Props to Child Components

            We saw a lot of examples that passed props to child JSX elements and child React components in previous challenges. 
            We may be wondering where those props come from. 
            A common pattern is to have a stateful component containing the state important to your app, that then renders child components.
            We want these components to have access to some pieces of that state, which are passed in as props.

            For example, we may have an App component that renders a Navbar, among other components. 
            In our App, we have state that contains a lot of user information, 
            but the Navbar only needs access to the user's username so it can display it. 
            We pass that piece of state to the Navbar component as a prop.

            This pattern illustrates some important paradigms in React.

            The first is unidirectional data flow. 
            State flows in one direction down the tree of your application's components, from the stateful parent component to child components. 
            The child components only receive the state data they need.

            The second is that complex stateful apps can be broken down into just a few, or maybe a single, stateful component. 
            The rest of your components simply receive state from the parent as props, and render a UI from that state. 
            It begins to create a separation where state management is handled in one part of code and UI rendering in another. 
            This principle of separating state logic from UI logic is one of React's key principles. 
            When it's used correctly, it makes the design of complex, stateful applications much easier to manage.

        React: Pass a Callback as Props

            We can pass state as props to child components, but we're not limited to passing data. 
            We can also pass handler functions or any method that's defined on a React component to a child component. 
            This is how we allow child components to interact with their parent components. 
            You pass methods to a child just like a regular prop. 
            It's assigned a name and we have access to that method name under this.props in the child component.
