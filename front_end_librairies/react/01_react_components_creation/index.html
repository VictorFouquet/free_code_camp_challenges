        React: Create a Simple JSX Element

            Intro: 
            React is an Open Source view library created and maintained by Facebook. 
            It's a great tool to render the User Interface (UI) of modern web applications.

            React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript. 
            This has several benefits. 
            It lets us use the full programmatic power of JavaScript within HTML, and helps to keep your code readable. 

            For instance, because JSX is a syntactic extension of JavaScript, we can actually write JavaScript directly within JSX. 
            To do this, we simply include the code we want to be treated as JavaScript within curly braces: 
            
                { 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }

            However, because JSX is not valid JavaScript, JSX code must be compiled into JavaScript. 
            The transpiler Babel is a popular tool for this process.

        React: Create a Complex JSX Element

            The last challenge was a simple example of JSX, but JSX can represent more complex HTML as well.
            One important thing to know about nested JSX is that it must return a single element.
            This one parent element would wrap all of the other levels of nested elements.
            For instance, several JSX elements written as siblings with no parent wrapper element will not transpile.
            Here's an example:

            Valid JSX:

                <div>
                    <p>Paragraph One</p>
                    <p>Paragraph Two</p>
                    <p>Paragraph Three</p>
                </div>

            Invalid JSX:

                <p>Paragraph One</p>
                <p>Paragraph Two</p>
                <p>Paragraph Three</p>

        */}

        const SecondJSX = (
            <div>
                <p>Paragraph One</p>
                <p>Paragraph Two</p>
                <p>Paragraph Three</p>
            </div>
        )

        React: Add Comments in JSX

            JSX is a syntax that gets compiled into valid JavaScript. 
            Sometimes, for readability, you might need to add comments to your code. 
            Like most programming languages, JSX has its own way to do this.

        React: Render HTML Elements to the DOM

            So far, we've learned that JSX is a convenient tool to write readable HTML within JavaScript. 
            With React, we can render this JSX directly to the HTML DOM using React's rendering API known as ReactDOM.

            ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which looks like this: 

                ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode) 

            The first argument is the React element or component that you want to render.
            The second argument is the DOM node that you want to render the component to.
            ReactDOM.render() must be called after the JSX element declarations, just like how you must declare variables before using them.

        React: Define an HTML Class in JSX

            Now that we're getting comfortable writing JSX, let's how it differs from HTML.

            So far, it may seem that HTML and JSX are exactly the same.

            One key difference in JSX is that you can no longer use the word class to define HTML classes. 
            This is because class is a reserved word in JavaScript. 
            Instead, JSX uses className.

            In fact, the naming convention for all HTML attributes and event references in JSX become camelCase. 
            For example, a click event in JSX is onClick, instead of onclick. Likewise, onchange becomes onChange. 
            While this is a subtle difference, it is an important one to keep in mind moving forward.

        const JSXWithClass = <div className="myDiv">I have a class name</div>;

        React: Learn About Self-Closing JSX Tags

            So far, we’ve seen how JSX differs from HTML in a key way with the use of className vs. class for defining HTML classes.

            Another important way in which JSX differs from HTML is in the idea of the self-closing tag.

            In HTML, almost all tags have both an opening and closing tag: <div></div>; the closing tag always has a forward slash before the tag name that you are closing. 
            However, there are special instances in HTML called “self-closing tags”, or tags that don’t require both an opening and closing tag before another tag can start.

            For example the line-break tag can be written as <br> or as <br />, but should never be written as <br></br>, since it doesn't contain any content.

            In JSX, the rules are a little different. Any JSX element can be written with a self-closing tag, and every element must be closed. 
            The line-break tag, for example, must always be written as <br /> in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled. 
            A <div>, on the other hand, can be written as <div /> or <div></div>. 
            The difference is that in the first syntax version there is no way to include anything in the <div />. 
            You will see in later challenges that this syntax is useful when rendering React components.

        React: Create a Stateless Functional Component

            Components are the core of React. Everything in React is a component and here you will learn how to create one.

            There are two ways to create a React component. 
            The first way is to use a JavaScript function. 
            Defining a component in this way creates a stateless functional component. 
            The concept of state in an application will be covered in later challenges. 
            For now, think of a stateless component as one that can receive data and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data. 
            (We'll cover the second way to create a React component in the next challenge.)

            To create a component with a function, we simply write a JavaScript function that returns either JSX or null. 
            One important thing to note is that React requires our function name to begin with a capital letter. 
            Here's an example of a stateless functional component that assigns an HTML class in JSX:

            // After being transpiled, the <div> will have a CSS class of 'customClass'

                const DemoComponent = function() {
                    return (
                        <div className='customClass' />
                    );
                };

            Because a JSX component represents HTML, we could put several components together to create a more complex HTML page. 
            This is one of the key advantages of the component architecture React provides. 
            It allows you to compose your UI from many separate, isolated components. 
            This makes it easier to build and maintain complex user interfaces.


        */}

        const MyStatelessComponent = function() {
            return (
                <div>
                    <p>I am a stateless functionnal component</p>
                </div>
            );
        }

        {/* ReactDOM.render(MyStatelessComponent, root) */}

        {/* 

            ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

        React: Create a React Component

            The other way to define a React component is with the ES6 class syntax. 
            In the following example, Kitten extends React.Component:

                class Kitten extends React.Component {
                    constructor(props) {
                        super(props);
                    }

                    render() {
                        return (
                            <h1>Hi</h1>
                        );
                    }
                }

            This creates an ES6 class Kitten which extends the React.Component class. 
            So the Kitten class now has access to many useful React features, such as local state and lifecycle hooks. 
            We aren't familiar with these terms yet, they will be covered in greater detail in later challenges. 
            Also notice the Kitten class has a constructor defined within it that calls super(). 
            It uses super() to call the constructor of the parent class, in this case React.Component. 
            The constructor is a special method used during the initialization of objects that are created with the class keyword. 
            It is best practice to call a component's constructor with super, and pass props to both. 
            This makes sure the component is initialized properly. 
            For now, we know that it is standard for this code to be included. 
            Soon we will see other uses for the constructor as well as props.

        */}

        class MyComponent extends React.Component {
            constructor(props) {
                super(props);
            }
            render() {
                return (
                    <div>
                        <h1>I am a React Component</h1>
                    </div>
                );
            }
        };

        React: Create a Component with CompositionPassed

            Now we will look at how we can compose multiple React components together. 
            Imagine we are building an App and have created three components, a Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer.

            To compose these components together, we could create an App parent component which renders each of these three components as children. 
            To render a component as a child in a React component, we include the component name written as a custom HTML tag in the JSX. 
            For example, in the render method we could write:

                return (
                    <App>
                    <Navbar />
                    <Dashboard />
                    <Footer />
                    </App>
                )

            When React encounters a custom HTML tag that references another component (a component name wrapped in < /> like in this example), 
            it renders the markup for that component in the location of the tag. 
            This should illustrate the parent/child relationship between the App component and the Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer.

        */}

        const ChildComponent = () => {
            return (
                <div>
                <p>I am the child</p>
                </div>
            );
        };

        class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
            constructor(props) {
                super(props);
            }

            render() {
                return (
                <div>
                    <h1>I am the parent</h1>
                    <ChildComponent />
                </div>
                );
            }
        };

        React: Use React to Render Nested ComponentsPassed

            There are many different ways we can compose components with React.
            Component composition is one of React's powerful features. 
            When you work with React, it is important to start thinking about your user interface in terms of components like the App example in the last challenge. 
            You break down your UI into its basic building blocks, and those pieces become the components. 
            This helps to separate the code responsible for the UI from the code responsible for handling your application logic. 
            It can greatly simplify the development and maintenance of complex projects.

        React: Compose React ComponentsPassed

            As the challenges continue to use more complex compositions with React components and JSX, there is one important point to note. 
            Rendering ES6 style class components within other components is no different than rendering the simple components we used in the last few challenges. 
            We can render JSX elements, stateless functional components, and ES6 class components within other components.

        React: Render a Class Component to the DOMPassed

            We may remember using the ReactDOM API in an earlier challenge to render JSX elements to the DOM. 
            The process for rendering React components will look very similar. 
            The past few challenges focused on components and composition, so the rendering was done for you behind the scenes. 
            However, none of the React code you write will render to the DOM without making a call to the ReactDOM API.

            Here's a refresher on the syntax: ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode). 
            The first argument is the React component that you want to render. 
            The second argument is the DOM node that you want to render that component within.

            React components are passed into ReactDOM.render() a little differently than JSX elements. 
            For JSX elements, you pass in the name of the element that you want to render. 
            However, for React components, we need to use the same syntax as if you were rendering a nested component, for example 
                ReactDOM.render(<ComponentToRender />, targetNode) 
            We use this syntax for both ES6 class components and functional components.
