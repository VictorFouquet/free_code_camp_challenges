        React: Pass Props to a Stateless Functional Component

            Let's take a look at another feature very common in React: props. 
            In React, we can pass props, or properties, to child components. 
            Say we have an App component which renders a child component called Welcome which is a stateless functional component. 
            We can pass Welcome a user property by writing:

                <App>
                    <Welcome user='Mark' />
                </App>

            We use custom HTML attributes created by us and supported by React to be passed to the component. 
            In this case, the created property user is passed to the component Welcome. 
            Since Welcome is a stateless functional component, it has access to this value like so:

                const Welcome = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.user}!</h1>

            It is standard to call this value props. 
            When dealing with stateless functional components, we basically consider it as an argument to a function which returns JSX. 
            We can access the value of the argument in the function body. 
            With class components, wee will see this is a little different.
            Note that for prop values to be evaluated as JavaScript, they must be enclosed in curly brackets, for instance date={Date()}.

        const CurrrentDate = (props) => {
            return(
                <div>
                    <p>Current date is : {props.date}</p>
                </div>
            );
        }

        class Calendar extends React.Component {
            constructor(props) {
                super(props);
            }

            render() {
                return (
                    <div>
                        <h3>What date is it?</h3>
                        <CurrrentDate date={Date()} />
                    </div>
                )
            }
        }

        {/* ReactDOM.render(<Calendar />, root) */}

        {/*

        React: Pass an Array as Props
    
            To pass an array to a JSX element, it must be treated as JavaScript and wrapped in curly braces.

                <ParentComponent>
                    <ChildComponent colors={["green", "blue", "red"]} />
                </ParentComponent>

            The child component then has access to the array property colors. 
            Array methods such as join() can be used when accessing the property.

                const ChildComponent = (props) => <p>{props.colors.join(', ')}</p> 

            This will join all colors array items into a comma separated string and produce:

                <p>green, blue, red</p> 
                
            Later, we will learn about other common methods to render arrays of data in React.

        const List = (props) => {
            return (
                <div>
                    <p>{props.tasks.join(", ")}</p>
                </div>
                );
            }

        class ToDo extends React.Component {
            constructor(props) {
                super(props);
            }

            render() {
                return (
                    <div>

        React: Use Default Props

            React also has an option to set default props. 
            You can assign default props to a component as a property on the component itself and React assigns the default prop if necessary. 
            This allows you to specify what a prop value should be if no value is explicitly provided. 
            For example, if we declare 

                MyComponent.defaultProps = { location: 'San Francisco' } 

            we have defined a location prop that's set to the string San Francisco, unless you specify otherwise. 
            React assigns default props if props are undefined, but if you pass null as the value for a prop, it will remain null.

        const Cart = (props) => {
            return (
                <div>
                    <h1>Cart Component</h1>
                </div>
            )
        }

        Cart.defaultProps = {items: 0}

        React: Override Default Props

            The ability to set default props is a useful feature in React. The way to override the default props is to explicitly set the prop values for a component.

            Note:The syntax to add a prop to a component looks similar to how we add HTML attributes. 
            However, since the value for quantity is an integer, it won't go in quotes but it should be wrapped in curly braces. 
            For example, {100}. 
            This syntax tells JSX to interpret the value within the braces directly as JavaScript.
        */
        }

        const Items = (props) => {
            return <h1>Current Quantity of Items in Cart : {props.quantity}</h1>
        }

        Items.defaultProps = {quantity: 0}

        class ShoppingCart extends React.Component {
            constructor(props){
                super(props);
            }

            render(){
                return <Items quantity={10} />
            }
        }

        React: Use PropTypes to Define the Props You Expect

            React provides useful type-checking features to verify that components receive props of the correct type. 
            For example, your application makes an API call to retrieve data that you expect to be in an array, which is then passed to a component as a prop. 
            You can set propTypes on your component to require the data to be of type array. 
            This will throw a useful warning when the data is of any other type.

            It's considered a best practice to set propTypes when you know the type of a prop ahead of time. 
            You can define a propTypes property for a component in the same way you defined defaultProps. 
            Doing this will check that props of a given key are present with a given type. 
            Here's an example to require the type function for a prop called handleClick:

                MyComponent.propTypes = { handleClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired }

            In the example above, the PropTypes.func part checks that handleClick is a function. 
            Adding isRequired tells React that handleClick is a required property for that component. 
            You will see a warning if that prop isn't provided. 
            Also notice that func represents function. 
            Among the seven JavaScript primitive types, function and boolean (written as bool) are the only two that use unusual spelling. 
            In addition to the primitive types, there are other types available. 
            For example, you can check that a prop is a React element. 
            Please refer to the documentation for all of the options.

            Note: As of React v15.5.0, PropTypes is imported independently from React, like this: import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

            import PropTypes from 'prop-types'
            
            Items.propTypes = {quantity: PropTypes.number};

        React: Access Props Using this.props

            The last several challenges covered the basic ways to pass props to child components. 
            But what if the child component that you're passing a prop to is an ES6 class component, rather than a stateless functional component? 
            The ES6 class component uses a slightly different convention to access props.
            Anytime you refer to a class component within itself, you use the this keyword. 
            To access props within a class component, you preface the code that you use to access it with this. 
            For example, if an ES6 class component has a prop called data, you write {this.props.data} in JSX.

        React: Review Using Props with Stateless Functional Components

            Except for the last challenge, we've been passing props to stateless functional components. 
            These components act like pure functions. 
            They accept props as input and return the same view every time they are passed the same props. 
            We may be wondering what state is, and the next challenge will cover it in more detail. 
            Before that, here's a review of the terminology for components.

            A stateless functional component is any function we write which accepts props and returns JSX. 
            A stateless component, on the other hand, is a class that extends React.Component, but does not use internal state (covered in the next challenge). 
            Finally, a stateful component is a class component that does maintain its own internal state. 
            We may see stateful components referred to simply as components or React components.

            A common pattern is to try to minimize statefulness and to create stateless functional components wherever possible. 
            This helps contain your state management to a specific area of your application. 
            In turn, this improves development and maintenance of your app by making it easier to follow how changes to state affect its behavior.
