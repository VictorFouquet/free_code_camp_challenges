        React: Use the Lifecycle Method componentWillMount

            React components have several special methods that provide opportunities to perform actions at specific points in the lifecycle of a component. 
            These are called lifecycle methods, or lifecycle hooks, and allow us to catch components at certain points in time. 
            This can be before they are rendered, before they update, before they receive props, before they unmount, and so on. 
            Here is a list of some of the main lifecycle methods:

                componentWillMount() 
                componentDidMount() 
                shouldComponentUpdate() 
                componentDidUpdate() 
                componentWillUnmount() 

            The next several lessons will cover some of the basic use cases for these lifecycle methods.

            Note: The componentWillMount Lifecycle method will be deprecated in a future version of 16.X and removed in version 17.

            ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

        React: Use the Lifecycle Method componentDidMount

            Most web developers, at some point, need to call an API endpoint to retrieve data. 
            If we're working with React, it's important to know where to perform this action.

            The best practice with React is to place API calls or any calls to your server in the lifecycle method componentDidMount(). 
            This method is called after a component is mounted to the DOM. 
            Any calls to setState() here will trigger a re-rendering of your component. 
            When we call an API in this method, and set our state with the data that the API returns, 
            it will automatically trigger an update once we receive the data.

            There is a mock API call in componentDidMount(). 
            It sets state after 2.5 seconds to simulate calling a server to retrieve data. 
            This example requests the current total active users for a site. 
            In the render method, render the value of activeUsers in the h1. 
            Watch what happens in the preview, and feel free to change the timeout to see the different effects.

        class MyComponent extends React.Component {
            constructor(props){
                super(props);
                this.state = {
                    activeUsers: 1000
                };
            }
            componentWillMount(){
                console.log("A component will mount");
            }
            componentDidMount(){
                setTimeout( () => {
                    this.setState({
                        activeUsers: this.state.activeUsers + 234
                    });
                }, 2500);
            }
            render(){
                return (
                    <div>
                        <h1>Active Users : {this.state.activeUsers}</h1>
                    </div>

            }
        }

        React: Add Event Listeners

            The componentDidMount() method is also the best place to attach any event listeners you need to add for specific functionality. 
            React provides a synthetic event system which wraps the native event system present in browsers. 
            This means that the synthetic event system behaves exactly the same regardless of the user's browser 
            - even if the native events may behave differently between different browsers.

            We've already been using some of these synthetic event handlers such as onClick(). 
            React's synthetic event system is great to use for most interactions you'll manage on DOM elements. 
            However, if you want to attach an event handler to the document or window objects, you have to do this directly.

        React: Optimize Re-Renders with shouldComponentUpdate

            So far, if any component receives new state or new props, it re-renders itself and all its children. 
            This is usually okay. 
            But React provides a lifecycle method you can call when child components receive new state or props, 
            and declare specifically if the components should update or not. 
            The method is shouldComponentUpdate(), and it takes nextProps and nextState as parameters.

            This method is a useful way to optimize performance. 
            For example, the default behavior is that your component re-renders when it receives new props, even if the props haven't changed. 
            You can use shouldComponentUpdate() to prevent this by comparing the props. 
            The method must return a boolean value that tells React whether or not to update the component. 
            You can compare the current props (this.props) to the next props (nextProps) to determine if you need to update or not, 
            and return true or false accordingly.

        React: Introducing Inline Styles

            There are other complex concepts that add powerful capabilities to your React code. 
            But we may be wondering about the more simple problem of how to style those JSX elements you create in React. 
            We likely know that it won't be exactly the same as working with HTML because of the way you apply classes to JSX elements.

            If we import styles from a stylesheet, it isn't much different at all. 
            We apply a class to our JSX element using the className attribute, and apply styles to the class in your stylesheet. 
            Another option is to apply inline styles, which are very common in ReactJS development.

            We apply inline styles to JSX elements similar to how you do it in HTML, but with a few JSX differences. 
            Here's an example of an inline style in HTML:

                <div style="color: yellow; font-size: 16px">Mellow Yellow</div>

            JSX elements use the style attribute, but because of the way JSX is transpiled, we can't set the value to a string. 
            Instead, we set it equal to a JavaScript object. Here's an example:

                <div style={{color: "yellow", fontSize: 16}}>Mellow Yellow</div>

            Notice how we camelCase the "fontSize" property? 
            React will apply the correct property name for us in the HTML.

            ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

        React: Add Inline Styles in React

            Hyphenated words like font-size are invalid syntax for JavaScript object properties, so React uses camel case. 
            As a rule, any hyphenated style properties are written using camel case in JSX.

            All property value length units (like height, width, and fontSize) are assumed to be in px unless otherwise specified. 
            If you want to use em, for example, you wrap the value and the units in quotes, like {fontSize: "4em"}. 
            Other than the length values that default to px, all other property values should be wrapped in quotes.

            textAlign: "center"

        React: Use Advanced JavaScript in React Render Method

            In previous challenges, we've learned how to inject JavaScript code into JSX code using curly braces, { }, 
            for tasks like accessing props, passing props, accessing state, 
            inserting comments into your code, and most recently, styling your components. 
            These are all common use cases to put JavaScript in JSX, 
            but they aren't the only way that you can utilize JavaScript code in your React components.

            We can also write JavaScript directly in our render methods, 
            before the return statement, without inserting it inside of curly braces. 
            This is because it is not yet within the JSX code. 
            When we want to use a variable later in the JSX code inside the return statement, 
            we place the variable name inside curly braces.

        React: Render with an If-Else Condition

            Another application of using JavaScript to control your rendered view is to tie the elements that are rendered to a condition. 
            When the condition is true, one view renders. 
            When it's false, it's a different view. 
            You can do this with a standard if/else statement in the render() method of a React component.

            ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

        React: Use && for a More Concise Conditional

            The if/else statements worked in the last challenge, but there's a more concise way to achieve the same result. 
            Imagine that we are tracking several conditions in a component and we want different elements to render depending on each of these conditions. 
            If we write a lot of else if statements to return slightly different UIs, we may repeat code which leaves room for error. 
            Instead, we can use the && logical operator to perform conditional logic in a more concise way. 
            This is possible because we want to check if a condition is true, and if it is, return some markup. Here's an example:

                {condition && <p>markup</p>}

            If the condition is true, the markup will be returned. 
            If the condition is false, the operation will immediately return false after evaluating the condition and return nothing. 
            We can include these statements directly in our JSX and string multiple conditions together by writing && after each one. 
            This allows us to handle more complex conditional logic in our render() method without repeating a lot of code.

        React: Use a Ternary Expression for Conditional Rendering

            Before moving on to dynamic rendering techniques, 
            there's one last way to use built-in JavaScript conditionals to render what you want: the ternary operator. 
            The ternary operator is often utilized as a shortcut for if/else statements in JavaScript. 
            They're not quite as robust as traditional if/else statements, but they are very popular among React developers. 
            One reason for this is because of how JSX is compiled, if/else statements can't be inserted directly into JSX code. 
            We might have noticed this a couple challenges ago — when an if/else statement was required, it was always outside the return statement. 
            Ternary expressions can be an excellent alternative if we want to implement conditional logic within our JSX. 
            Recall that a ternary operator has three parts, but we can combine several ternary expressions together. 
            Here's the basic syntax:

                condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse

                };
                this.submit = this.submit.bind(this);

        React: Render Conditionally from Props

            So far, we've seen how to use if/else, &&, null and the ternary operator 

                (condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse) 

            to make conditional decisions about what to render and when. 
            However, there's one important topic left to discuss that lets you combine 
            any or all of these concepts with another powerful React feature: props. 
            Using props to conditionally render code is very common with React developers
            — that is, they use the value of a given prop to automatically make decisions about what to render.

            In this challenge, you'll set up a child component to make rendering decisions based on props. 
            We'll also use the ternary operator, but we can see how several of the other concepts 
            that were covered in the last few challenges might be just as useful in this context.

            To do this, we check for a condition, and if that condition is met, 
            we modify the styles object that's assigned to the JSX elements in the render method.

            This paradigm is important to understand because it is a dramatic shift from the more traditional 
            approach of applying styles by modifying DOM elements directly (which is very common with jQuery, for example).  
            When we set a style object based on a condition, we describe how the UI should look as a function of the application's state. 
            There is a clear flow of information that only moves in one direction. 
            This is the preferred method when writing applications with React.

        React: Give Sibling Elements a Unique Key Attribute

            The last challenge showed how the map method is used to dynamically render a number of elements based on user input. 
            However, there was an important piece missing from that example. 
            When we create an array of elements, each one needs a key attribute set to a unique value. 
            React uses these keys to keep track of which items are added, changed, or removed. 
            This helps make the re-rendering process more efficient when the list is modified in any way.

            Note: Keys only need to be unique between sibling elements, they don't need to be globally unique in our application.

        React: Use Array.filter() to Dynamically Filter an Array

            The map array method is a powerful tool that you will use often when working with React. 
            Another method related to map is filter, which filters the contents of an array based on a condition, then returns a new array. 
            For example, if you have an array of users that all have a property online which can be set to true or false, 
            we can filter only those users that are online by writing:

                let onlineUsers = users.filter(user => user.online);

        React: Render React on the Server with renderToString

            So far, we have been rendering React components on the client. 
            Normally, this is what we will always do. 
            However, there are some use cases where it makes sense to render a React component on the server. 
            Since React is a JavaScript view library and we can run JavaScript on the server with Node, this is possible. 
            In fact, React provides a renderToString() method we can use for this purpose.

            There are two key reasons why rendering on the server may be used in a real world app. 
            First, without doing this, our React apps would consist of a relatively empty HTML file 
            and a large bundle of JavaScript when it's initially loaded to the browser. 
            This may not be ideal for search engines that are trying to index the content of your pages so people can find us. 
            If we render the initial HTML markup on the server and send this to the client, 
            the initial page load contains all of the page's markup which can be crawled by search engines. 
            Second, this creates a faster initial page load experience because the rendered HTML is smaller than the JavaScript code of the entire app. 
            React will still be able to recognize our app and manage it after the initial load.
